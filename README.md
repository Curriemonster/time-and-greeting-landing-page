# time-and-greeting-landing-page
a landing page that updates the time, background image and greeting in realtime
i truely failed 
This is a task set by a propspective employer, a task that I believe I have truely failed at (still awaiting feedback) but it is my first attempt at a landing page, 
my first attempt at using javascript and my first junior (at 41 years old) role interview.

I've added comments in the code to explain what im trying to do, however, I have run into a brick wall regarding how to fix the issues. any edits welcomed with open arms.

regardless of if I get the job or not, I wish to finish the project, add it to my portfolio and try again.
